# CompTIA Question Wording: Quick Reference Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **EVERY question needs a QUALIFIER word** (BEST, MOST, FIRST, LEAST)
2. **"Given a scenario"** is CompTIA's signature opening
3. **Two answers should seem correct** - the qualifier determines the winner
4. **Question the obvious** appears in troubleshooting methodology
5. **No penalties for wrong answers** - never leave blank

## ðŸ”‘ POWER WORDS QUICK REFERENCE

### BEST
âœ… "What is the BEST method?"
âœ… "Which option BEST describes?"
âŒ Multiple solutions work, but only ONE is optimal

### FIRST
âœ… "What should you do FIRST?"
âœ… "Which is the FIRST step?"
âŒ Later steps may also be correct, but order matters

### MOST
âœ… "MOST likely cause"
âœ… "MOST appropriate solution"
âœ… "MOST secure method"

### LEAST  
âœ… "LEAST likely cause"
âœ… "LEAST effective method"
âš ï¸ EASY TO MISS - watch for negative questions

### MINIMUM/MAXIMUM
âœ… "Requires MINIMUM of three drives"
âœ… "MAXIMUM supported memory"
âŒ Don't confuse "can use" with "requires"

## âš™ï¸ THE 6-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY

**MEMORIZE THE EXACT WORDING:**

1. **Identify the problem**
   - Question the user
   - Identify changes
   - Perform backups

2. **Establish a theory (question the obvious)**
   - Research if necessary
   - Start with simple causes

3. **Test the theory**
   - Confirm â†’ proceed to next step
   - Not confirmed â†’ new theory OR escalate

4. **Establish plan and implement solution**
   - Refer to vendor instructions
   - Consider corporate policies

5. **Verify full functionality + preventative measures**
   - Actually test the fix
   - Prevent future occurrence

6. **Document findings, actions, outcomes**

âš ï¸ **Common Trap:** "Issue was resolved" â‰  you've verified it (Step 5)

## ðŸŽ¨ DISTRACTOR PATTERNS

**Type A: Plausible But Technically Wrong**
- Sounds good but violates specs
- "RAID 0 provides redundancy" âŒ

**Type B: Right Answer to Wrong Question**
- Correct but for different scenario
- Documentation before verification âŒ

**Type C: Incomplete Solution**
- Partial fix only
- "Hide games" vs "Remove games" âŒ

**Type D: Wrong Sequential Order**
- Right action, wrong time
- Testing theory before establishing it âŒ

**Type E: Absolute Language (Usually Wrong)**
- "ALWAYS," "NEVER," "ALL," "NONE"
- Too rigid for tech scenarios âŒ

---

## ðŸ” WORDING TRAPS TO AVOID

### âŒ DON'T WRITE:
- "All of the above"
- "None of the above"  
- Trick questions or deception
- Ambiguous technical terms
- Questions with multiple correct answers (except checkboxes)
- "The client accidentally..." (blame language)

### âœ… DO WRITE:
- "Which of the following..."
- Specific technical terminology
- Real-world scenarios
- Clear single correct answer
- "A user reports..." (neutral language)

---

## ðŸ“Š ANSWER CHOICE RULES

### Multiple Choice Single (Radio Button â­•)
- Exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- ONE correct answer
- Two should be plausible

### Multiple Choice Multiple (Checkbox â˜)
- **2 correct = 5 total choices**
- **3 correct = 6 total choices**
- Instructions say "Choose two" or "Select all"

### Fill-in-Blank
- Usually expect acronym or command
- Case-sensitive varies
- 1-3 words maximum
- Example: "chown" not "change owner"

---

## ðŸŽ¯ SCENARIO CONSTRUCTION

### Good Scenario Structure:
```
1. SETUP (1-2 sentences)
   "A technician is building a CAD workstation."

2. REQUIREMENTS (1-2 sentences)
   "The user needs maximum performance for 3D rendering.
    Budget is not a concern."

3. DATA (if needed)
   "Available components:
    - CPU A: 8 cores @ 3.0 GHz
    - CPU B: 16 cores @ 3.5 GHz"

4. QUESTION + QUALIFIER
   "Which CPU should the technician choose FIRST?"
```

### Bad Scenario (Too Much Fluff):
```
"Steve has been working at the company for 5 years.
His office is on the third floor near the break room.
Last Tuesday after lunch, he noticed his computer was
running slowly. He tried restarting but that didn't help.
His coworker suggested checking the RAM..."
```
âŒ **Too much irrelevant information!**

## ðŸ† QUALIFIER WORD DECISION TREE

**Start here:** What am I testing?

â†’ **Sequential order?**
   Use: FIRST, NEXT, LAST

â†’ **Comparison/Choice?**
   Use: BEST, MOST appropriate

â†’ **Probability?**
   Use: MOST likely, LEAST likely

â†’ **Requirement/Spec?**
   Use: MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, required

â†’ **Negative question?**
   Use: NOT, EXCEPT, LEAST

â†’ **Effectiveness/Quality?**
   Use: BEST, MOST effective

## ðŸŽ“ DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

### Hardware Questions
- Focus on specifications (GB, MHz, cores)
- Component compatibility
- Physical installation
- Power requirements
- "High-end," "enterprise-grade"

### Software/OS Questions
- Menu navigation (Control Panel > Settings > ...)
- Command syntax (exact formatting)
- Version-specific features
- User permissions
- "right-click," "administrator privileges"

### Network Questions
- Protocol names (TCP, UDP, DHCP, DNS)
- IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6)
- Port numbers
- Connectivity testing
- "ping," "tracert," "gateway"

### Security Questions
- Attack types (phishing, smishing, vishing)
- Controls (technical, administrative, physical)
- Principles (least privilege, defense in depth)
- Threat actors and vectors
- "malware," "exploit," "vulnerability"

## ðŸ“‹ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any question, verify:

â˜‘ Contains ONE qualifier word (BEST/MOST/FIRST/etc.)
â˜‘ Has single unambiguous correct answer
â˜‘ Uses precise technical terminology
â˜‘ Scenario is realistic and concise
â˜‘ Distractors are plausible but wrong
â˜‘ No cultural/regional bias
â˜‘ Appropriate difficulty for certification level
â˜‘ Tests application, not just memorization
â˜‘ Grammar and spelling perfect
â˜‘ Matches CompTIA's professional tone

---

## ðŸš¨ RED FLAGS

If your question has any of these, revise:

ðŸš© Two answers that are both technically correct
ðŸš© No qualifier word in question stem
ðŸš© Scenario longer than 4 sentences
ðŸš© Obscure technical fact as focus
ðŸš© "Always" or "never" in correct answer
ðŸš© Blaming or judgmental language
ðŸš© Obsolete technology (unless testing legacy)
ðŸš© Obvious correct answer (too easy)
ðŸš© No realistic scenario connection

---

## ðŸ’¡ EXAMPLES: GOOD VS BAD

### âŒ BAD QUESTION:
```
"What is RAM used for?"

A) Storage
B) Memory
C) Processing  
D) Graphics
```
**Problems:** Too simple, no scenario, no qualifier, ambiguous terms

### âœ… GOOD QUESTION:
```
"A technician is upgrading a workstation that frequently runs
multiple virtual machines simultaneously. Users report the system
is slow when switching between VMs.

Which of the following upgrades would provide the MOST improvement?

A) Increase HDD capacity from 500GB to 1TB
B) Upgrade RAM from 8GB to 32GB
C) Replace CPU with higher clock speed
D) Add dedicated graphics card"
```
**Why it's good:**
- Clear scenario with context
- Has qualifier word (MOST)
- Tests application of knowledge
- Multiple plausible answers
- B is correct (RAM impacts VM performance most)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL TIP

**The CompTIA "Feel":**

CompTIA questions feel:
- Professional but accessible
- Practical and job-focused  
- Precise without being pedantic
- Fair but discriminating
- Scenario-based when possible
- Clear about what's being asked

They DON'T feel:
- Academic or theoretical
- Tricky or gotcha-style
- Ambiguous or vague
- Overly complex or simple
- Testing trivia
- Biased toward memorization

**When in doubt:** Would a hiring manager ask this question to assess if someone can do the job? If yes, it's probably good. If no, revise.
